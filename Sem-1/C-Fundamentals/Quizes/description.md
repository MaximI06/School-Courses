### Circle Area Calculator

This C program calculates the area of a circle after receiving a user’s name and the circle's radius as inputs. The user is prompted to enter their name and the radius of the circle, and the program then calculates the area using the formula area = pi * radius * radius. Finally, it displays a greeting message with the user’s name and the computed area.

### Event Ticketing System

This C program functions as a simple ticketing system based on age-based pricing. It prompts the user to enter their age, then calculates the ticket price: free for children under 14, $5 for teenagers (14-18), $20 for adults (19-64), and $10 for seniors (65+). The program uses conditional statements to determine and display the correct ticket price. This task reinforces the use of if, else if, and else statements for implementing conditional logic based on user input.

### Code Analysis and Output Prediction

This C program demonstrates the use of increment and assignment operations, as well as conditional statements. The program performs a series of calculations and updates on three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
