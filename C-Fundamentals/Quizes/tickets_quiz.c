//Question 3. Create a C program that acts as a ticketing system for a small event. 
//The program should prompt the user to enter their age and print out the cost of 
//the ticket according to the following age-based pricing structure:
//Children under 14 years of age get in free.
//Teenagers between 14 and 18 years of age pay a reduced fee of $5.
//Adults between 19 and 64 years of age pay the full price of $20.
//Seniors 65 years and older pay a reduced fee of $10.

//Instructions
//Use appropriate data types for storing age and ticket prices.
//Employ conditional statements to determine the ticket price based on the user's age.
//Make sure to handle input errors gracefully and provide clear output messages.
//Your program should only use conditional statements (if, else-if, else) for the logic.
//Note: You are not required to handle non-numeric input in this exercise. Assume the user will always
//input an integer value for their age.
